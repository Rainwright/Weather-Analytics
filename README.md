PFDA Assignment - Data Analysis on Hourly Weather Data

Temperature

* [x] Analysis 1 - What is the mean, median, standard deviation, min and max temperature at both airports for each season/ What are the mean temperature of each season in a year

* [x] Analysis 1.1 - How temperature affects wind direction from both airports

Wind

* [x] Analysis 2 - What is the mean, median, standard deviation, min and max wind speed at both airports for each season

* [x] Analysis 2.1 - What is the mean, min and max wind gust at both airports for each season

* [x] Analysis 2.2 - What is the mean, min and max wind direction at both airports for each season #removed as found unsuitable

* [x] Analysis 2.3 - Does wind gust increments with wind speed (Relationship between wind gust and wind speed)?

* [x] Analysis 2.4 - When is the most dangerous time to take flight based on wind speed and wind direction

Precipitation

* [x] Analysis 3 - What is the mean, median, standard deviation, min and max precipitation at both airports for each season

* [x] Analysis 3.1 - How to determine rain or snow using precipitation and temperature, how does it look against time? 

* [x] Analysis 3.2 - Does wind direction affects precipitation

Visibility
* [x] Analysis 4 - What is the mean, median, standard deviation, min and max visibility at both airports for each season

* [x] Analysis 4.1 - How does hour of the day affects visibility

* [x] Analysis 4.2 - Does precipitation effects visibility 

Dewpoint
* [x] Analysis 5 - What is the mean, median, standard deviation, min and max dewpoint at both airports for each season

* [x] Analysis 5.1 - Does temperature and dewpoint affects precipitation

Humidity
* [x] Analysis 6 - What is the mean, median, standard deviation, min and max humidity at both airports for each season

* [x] Analysis 6.1 - How to predict frosting using temperature, dewpoint, humidity

Note: 
1. Produce all mean, median, standard deviation
      
2. Relate with airplane
